Between the soft chairs and the door on the Northwest corner of the coffee shop is the free book section.  Box is found there.

## Golden Triangle Fractal:

![](https://i.imgur.com/Z6u7zTS.png)

The figure above is the Golden Triangle: the triangle with a base that is one over the Golden Ratio of the other two sides in length.  It is made up of a sequence of smaller Golden Triangles, each smaller than the previous by the Golden Ratio.  For more on the Golden Ratio watch the Disney film "Donald in MathemagicLand". It's on youtube.

This Triangle can be used to create any kind of symbols based on fivefold symmetry.  This includes pentagons, pentagrams, Penrose tiles, various figures based on logarithmic spirals, and decagons.  Symbols can be colored in with basic simple colors to make a very large number of potential symbols from this one triangle.  If symbols are made using just a Golden Triangle traced at various scales and basic rainbow colors, those symbols can be replicated by anyone else with the Golden Triangle and color tools.  This can replicate to any physical media using any kind of colors: paint pen on rock, wood and brick, sharpies on cardboard, colored pencils on high quality card stock.  

Any media with a symbol on it can be tracked online by making a channel code and using that as a hashtag.  A channel code is created by rolling pairs of dice and using a dice grid decoder to turn the dice rolls into letters and numbers.  Repeat as needed for some number of characters, 6 is a good starting point as that is a space of 1 billion channels.

- this page is basically static.  Dynamic content is physical and follows hashtags on other open media
- instructions to replicate the page: domain, hosting, new page, edit content, back up, if this page is mostly static, replication requires almost no edits after it happens, just keep replicating this page 

To replicate the triangles, open a text file and copy the code from [this link into it](https://pastebin.com/raw/4tJEu8Ff).  Save that file as triangles.svg(note the ending).  Then go to [Ponoko.com](https://www.ponoko.com), a laser cut/etch on demand company who'll get them made and shipped to you.  Each unit will be 21 shapes, so 100 sets are 2100 triangles is a lot of triangles.  When you upload to ponoko.com you'll need to specify the width of the file, that is 7.42 inches to make triangles that are 3 inches on the long sides.  Select neon green transluscent acrylic, 0.12 inches thick.  In large quantities this should break down to about 50 cents per triangle.  Buy in bulk and distribute in art/coffee locations.  Note the "etch" layer is the one with the small detail triangles(red) and the "cut" layer is just the outlines.  This shape can also be printed out using a public laser cutter in the maker space of a public library.
