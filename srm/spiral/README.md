# Spiral

    spiral = {
        golden token,
        artbox,
        triangle,
        web server/host/page/url,
        skeletron
    }

    Golden Token = {
        6x6 decoder,
        dice and dice bag,
        triangle in triangle repository,
        physical media with symbol based on Phi,
        hashtags,
        tale(story of a card/token/marker),
        lore(how to replicate, how to use)
    }


## Token replication:

1. locate a golden triangle, art supplies and physical media to decorate, dice and decoder
2. create a symbol on media, color it in
3. roll dice and use decoder to create random string of letters and numbers, which is the hashtag, add that to media
4. tell other people about the token, either buy them something or ask them to buy you something(doesn't matter which) and post the event on the hashtag using either Twitter, Instagram or both, show the person how to replicate the whole thing and replicate again
5. create a system for following the hashtag, either direct follow on Instagram or a Twitter bot with retweets to follow the hashtag on Twitter
