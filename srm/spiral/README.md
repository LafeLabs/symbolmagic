# Spiral

    spiral = {
        token,
        artbox,
        triangle,
        book + shapes of reality,
        web server/host/page/url,
        skeletron,
        signs
    }

    Golden Token = {
        6x6 decoder,
        dice and dice bag,
        triangle in triangle repository,
        physical media with symbol based on Phi,
        hashtags,
        tale(story of a card/token/marker),
        lore(how to replicate, how to use)
    }


## Token Replication:

1. locate a golden triangle, art supplies and physical media to decorate, dice and decoder
2. create a symbol on media, color it in
3. roll dice and use decoder to create random string of letters and numbers, which is the hashtag, add that to media
4. tell other people about the token, either buy them something or ask them to buy you something(doesn't matter which) and post the event on the hashtag using either Twitter, Instagram or both, show the person how to replicate the whole thing and replicate again
5. create a system for following the hashtag, either direct follow on Instagram or a Twitter bot with retweets to follow the hashtag on Twitter

## ArtBox

1. make a 6 inch on a side equilateral triangle to use as a template(use Shapes of Reality, print and trace, or use compass)
2. use template to trace and then cut out 5 triangles and 2 diamond shapes made from a pair of connected triangles
3. lay out triangles and diamonds as an octahedron/tetrahedron, tape and fold and assemble, cut holes and add carrying straps
4. create specific media connecting the artbox to the rest of the media here: place(describe, use map, link to a marker symbol), url, hashtags, other media, replication of artbox
5. fill with art supplies needed for this set: markers, paint pens, pens, colored pencils, crayons, cardboard tools, sharpies, drafting tools, shape set, golden triangles
6. use to create shared art tool repositories in physical space tied to a spiral to replicate other art in the set

1. Get a new web hosting account on either a free or paid hosting service above.  All domain names should be linked to physical places, based either on the local watershed geography or local street geography, with a non-commercial ending like .xyz or .net or .org rather than .com.  
2. On the new web hosting account you have set up, create a new file in the main web directory called replicator.php, open that file in the text editor on the server and copy the [code found here](php/replicator.txt) onto it.  Point a web browser to the web address of your new page, followed by /replicator.php, then click on the link that appears to go to your new page
