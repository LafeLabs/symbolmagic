# Shapes of Reality

### [< link to buy the acrylic shapes from actiongeometry.com >](https://www.actiongeometry.com/shapes)

These shapes represent the core symmetries and scales that define our Reality.  They allow us to create self-replicating symbols which anyone else with the shape set can easily and reliably copy without any artistic skill.  All shapes are laser cut from florescent green acrylic.
